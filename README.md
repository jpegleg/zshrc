# zshrc
Install zsh and ohmyzsh and apply custom jpegleg theme.

chmod +x jpegleg-zsh-install

./jpegleg-zsh-install

### First you will have default theme after zsh is installed from the above command, then exit to keep going:

exit

### Then the new theme will be installed and ready for your next session

zsh

The result is similar to dark blood theme, but with a datestamp and some dashes in the prompt.
And this also adds in alias' and functions from https://github.com/jpegleg/metarc/blob/master/metaRC_alt-freebsd to ~/.zshrc
